# My_Learning
These are examples of programming exercises created during
my learning process.

As a programmer who started with Basic and Pascal (thousand
of years ago), I am doing my job of trying to keep current 
with new programming languages and development frameworks.

I will be mainly focused on mastering:
  - Python
  - Flutter
  - ReactJS

Luckily, there are great learning resources that provide 
really funny, engaging and relevant labs.

Here you will find two types of code snippets:
  - Small exercises produced when attending the courses
  - Projects with more complexity level

I hope this will inspire you on your learning journey.

Carlos.
