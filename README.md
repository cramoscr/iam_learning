# My_Learning
As a programmer who started with Basic and Pascal (many
years ago), I am working on my skill sets to keep in shape with new trends.

I will keep mainly focused on mastering:
  - Python
  - Flutter
  - ReactJS

Luckily, there are plenty of valuable (funny) learning resources.

Here you will find two types of code snippets:
  - Small exercises produced when attending the courses
  - Projects with higher complexity level

This repository includes some gaming examples (I hope you will enjoy), along with some highly specialized libraries.

I hope this will help you on your learning journey.

Carlos.
