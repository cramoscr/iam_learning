# iam_learning

Hello, my name is Carlos.

I still remember when I was a teenager and considered computers
science-fiction things.  It was on 90's and such devices
was uncommon in this place.  Plenty of curiosity and scared I decided
to start learning programming, by myself.

After plenty of years, here I am (with plenty of curiosity, again ) revamping
my developing skills.

Here you will find some programming samples created during this
refreshing process.

I will be mainly focused on learning:
  - Python
  - Flutter
  - ReactJS / ExpressJS

What can I produce with such new skills ? What the future could
bring ?  This is something really exciting to me.

Carlos.
