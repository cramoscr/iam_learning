         PEP8 recommends: 72 char
     - Blank lines
         > Surround top-level function and class definitions with two 
           blank lines.
         > Method definitions inside a class are surrounded by a single 
           blank line.
         > Extra blank lines may be used (sparingly) to separate groups of 
           related functions.
         > Blank lines may be omitted between a bunch of related one-liners 
           (e.g. a set of dummy implementations).
         > Use blank lines in functions, sparingly, to indicate logical 
           sections.
