[ ] My AWS environment [ how to run ]
    updated: 27/jan/2025

    + Starting the EC2 instance
        - For my ReactJS labs its good enough to connect  using the web
          browser based client:
               "Connect using EC2 Instance Connect"

        - Every time you run the instance, it will get a new public IP address
          so, write it down !

        - It has a security group which allows HTTP/HTTPS inbound connections from any

    + Running a basic ReactJS for testing purposes

        - enter into the AWS console
             $ cd my_repo/reactjs/_projects/pcatalog
             $ npm start

        + Open new Chrome tab and enter 

             http://[aws_public_ip_address]:3000    [ ENTER ]
 
           { this worked on 27/ene/2025 }
