This is my sandbox where Cirios-App will be made.

[ ] React-based Picture gallery examples
    + React repository
        https://reactjsexample.com/tag/gallery/

    + Main candidate
        https://reactjsexample.com/blogs-and-gallery-app-built-with-react-js/
  
    + Beautiful example:
      https://galleria-seven.vercel.app/

[ ] Cloud platform:
    + AWS Amplify looks promising because:
         a. Extremely low price 
         b. Provides an React hosting example
         c. Provides access to S3 for picture storage
         d. Provides a Figma automation mecanism
    
    + There is a Google Photos picture gallery so easily
        - It's no beauty but functional
